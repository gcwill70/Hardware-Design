# Description
The Data Buffer will temporarily hold data that is passed through the SoC master (primarily the CPU) to the SDRAM chip itself. In the case of a write, data is sent from the SoC master, through the SDRAM Controller, to the SDRAM chip. In the case of a read, the access command is sent via AHB-lite from the SoC master through the SDRAM controller and onto the chip; the retrieved data is then sent from the SDRAM chip, through the SDRAM controller, then back to the SoC master. See the [design environment diagram](https://github.com/gcwill70/Hardware-Design/blob/master/SDRAM-Controller/Diagrams/Top%20Level/Block%20Diagrams/Design%20Environment.pdf).
