# Description
The Main Control Unit determines what the controller's overall state is (single-word write, burst read, auto-refresh, etc.). Please see its [state diagram](https://github.com/gcwill70/Hardware-Design/blob/master/SDRAM-Controller/Diagrams/Main%20Control%20Unit/State%20Diagrams/Main%20Control%20Unit.pdf).
