# Description
The Subroutine Command Generation block (or SCG for short) is responsible for decoding the opcode that is generated by the Main Control Unit into a series of SDRAM chip commands. I chose the word "subroutine" to refer to the series of chip commands that are required to carry out a certain task. For example, to execute a single-word read the "read" command is sent to the chip interface and is followed by 3 cycles of the "nop" command in order to obey the SDRAM chip's timing delays (see the [SDRAM chip datasheet](http://www.issi.com/WW/pdf/42-45R-S_86400D-16320D-32160D.pdf) for more info).
